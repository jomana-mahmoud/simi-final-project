    Stars are giant balls of hot gas – mostly hydrogen, with some helium and small amounts of other elements. Every star has its own life cycle, ranging from a few million to trillions of years, and its properties change as it ages<h4>Click the button below to learn more about stars:</h4>

   <p>A black hole is a place in space where gravity pulls so much that even light can not get out. The gravity is so strong because matter has been squeezed into a tiny space. This can happen when a star is dying.

Because no light can get out, people can’t see black holes. They are invisible. Space telescopes with special tools can help find black holes. The special tools can see how stars that are very close to black holes act differently than other stars.</p>

   <p>A planet is a large, rounded astronomical body that is generally required to be in orbit around a star,
     stellar remnant, or brown dwarf, and is not one itself.
     [1] The Solar System has eight planets by the most restrictive definition of the term: the terrestrial planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars, 
     and the giant planets Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.
     The best available theory of planet formation is the nebular hypothesis, 
     which posits that an interstellar cloud collapses out of a nebula to create a young protostar orbited by a protoplanetary disk. 
     Planets grow in this disk by the gradual accumulation of material driven by gravity, a process called accretion.</p>
